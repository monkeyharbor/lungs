<h1>ABOUT LUNG REPAIR</h1>

<h3> REPAIR STATUS <br>	
by Maria Maciak </h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>DESCRIPTION
Clicking on the “locate lung” button shows text indicating the lung’s status and whereabouts, which are subway stations. Depending on the borough, the colors of background animation change. If the button is clicked again, new lung status and coinciding location are shown. Sounds of lungs are looped; they start and stop whenever the user clicks. Information on the bottom informs us that "access to the lungs was made possible by RFID Microchip Technologies."</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>CONCEPT
<br>
The theme of breath presented itself as I looked at MTA datasets and saw one called “Elevator/Escalator Status.” The data field called “reason” had words such as “capital replacement,” “under investigation,” “repair,” all of which can be applied to humans. I altered the duplicates of values by adding “lost,” “unavailable,” “needs help,” and others. With their arteries (belts, chains, corridors) and lobes (cabins, station), both lungs and escalators/elevators are expected to efficiently carry out the work. Yet they are fragile, often broken, systems. 
<br>
The feeling alludes to a dystopian world where one’s lungs are not where they are supposed to be. Even today, lungs are in great danger as racist police stop people’s breath, as covid reigns, and forests burn.</p> 
<br>
<br>
<p>
PRODUCTION
<br>
The site is HTML/CSS/JSON. The animation script and sound (mix edit of various lung sounds) were put together in p5js. 
<br>
The project uses a static dataset from MTA (the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York). It incorporates value sets from three data keys: station, reason, and borough. The original data is an XML file that was converted to JSON.
<br>
I used MTA’s font, which is Helvetica. The page first loads as black and yellow, similar to Metrocard’s colors. The animation color scheme is reminiscent of signal lights on subway tracks and subway color lines.
