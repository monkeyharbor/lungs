<h3>LUNG REPAIR</h3>
<h4>BY MARIA MACIAK</h4>

<br>
<p>DESCRIPTION <br>
    Clicking on the “locate lung” button reveals lung’s status and whereabouts, which are subway stations. Depending on the borough, the colors of background animation change. Sounds of lungs start and stop whenever the user clicks. Info on the bottom informs us that <em>"access to the lungs was made possible by RFID Microchip Technologies."</em>
</p>
<br>   
<p>CONCEPT<br>
    The theme of breath presented itself via a dataset for NYC subway elevator/escalator status. The data field "reason" had values such as <em>capital replacement</em> and <em> under investigation.</em> I replaced duplicates with <em>lost, unavailable, needs help, </em>etc.
</p>
<p>
    With their arteries (belts, chains, corridors) and lobes (cabins, station), both lungs and escalators/elevators are expected to efficiently carry out the work. Yet they are fragile, often broken, systems.
</p> 
<p>
    The site alludes to a dystopian world where one’s lungs are not where they are supposed to be. On this website we check the condition of our detached organs. Even today, lungs are in great danger as racist police stop people’s breath, as covid reigns, and forests burn.
</p> 
<br>
<p>PRODUCTION<br>
The site is HTML/CSS/JSON. The animation script and sound (mix of lung sounds) were put together in p5js. 
</p>
<p>
The project uses a static dataset from MTA (the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York). It incorporates value sets from three of its data keys: station, reason, and borough. Reason values were modified. The original data is an XML file that was converted to JSON. 
</p>
<p>
I used MTA’s font, which is Helvetica. The page loads in black and yellow, Metrocard’s colors. The animation color schemes are reminiscent of subway signal lights and subway color lines.
